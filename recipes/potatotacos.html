    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a copy cat recipe of Taco Bell's addictive potato tacos. The recipe is quick and easy, made with many spices you probably already have in your pantry.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs. russet potatoes, washed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup neutral oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup corn starch </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the potatoes to a large pot and fill it with water about 1-2 inches above the potatoes. Bring the water to a boil on high heat. Cook for about 20 minutes (timed from turning on the burner), or until slightly fork-tender. We do not want the potatoes to cook all the way since we will be baking them after this.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a full sized baking sheet (or two half sheets) with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
        <li>Grab a small bowl and mix together the corn starch, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and cumin. </li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are parboiled, dice them into 1″ squares, and add them to a large bowl. Add oil to your potatoes and gently mix together until fully coated. Sprinkle over the spice blend and mix through until they are coated on all sides.        </li>
        <li>Transfer seasoned potatoes to the baking sheet(s) and spread out to a single layer.         </li>
        <li>Place into the oven and bake for 40 minutes, mixing potatoes halfway through.</li>
        <li>Serve in a flour tortilla with your favorite taco fixings and <a href="sourcream.html">zesty sour cream.</a></li>
    </ol>
